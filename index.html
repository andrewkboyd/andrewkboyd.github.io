<div class="man-section">
  <p>
  Hey, Andrew [QUESTION?] [STATEMENT.] [[COMMAND|EXCITEMENT]!]
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h3>

<div class="man-section">
  <p>
    I am a passionate technologist. I find joy in the act and process of problem solving.  Every problem is a process of discovery and learning, from finding vulnerabilities in a system or application, to building software and securing systems.  I am driven by exploration and the desire to know <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> systems work the way they do.
  </p>

  <p>
    I often have strong opinions, but am always open to discussing and challenging assumptions.  I value diverse opinions and engaging in respectful, healthy, and constructive discussions about any topic.  I fully expect that I will be wrong, a lot, and hope that others will feel comfortable in presenting their view and correction where I am in error.
  </p>

  <p>
    The table below lists the various roles that I claim and a brief definition of what they mean
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Hacker</dt>
    <dd>I expose weakness in pursuit of strength</dd>
    <dt>Systems Engineer / Administrator</dt>
    <dd>I design, build, and secure systems.  *nix, Windows, Solaris, iOS (Cisco or Apple), etc.; I figure it out, and use it when needed</dd>
    <dt>Threat Hunter</dt>
    <dd>I search for evil, to expose and defend against it</dd>
    <dt>Software Engineer</dt>
    <dd>Formerly a full-time role, I continue to develop quality software when necessary</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    These roles and definitions are the things I have done, and seek to do continually.  Each is used when necessary and my primary focus changes over time. See <a href="#history">HISTORY</a>
