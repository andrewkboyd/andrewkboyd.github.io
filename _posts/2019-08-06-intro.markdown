I plan to start releasing posts of my research and a library that I will use for reference and collected material.  I will target approximately one post per month to start, and see how it goes.  Topics will be on anything and everything technical; attack research, reverse engineering, systems administration / devops, software engineering, processes and procedures related to any of the previous topics.

Stay tuned.
